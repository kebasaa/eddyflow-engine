# FLUXNET layout regression harness

Guards the per-gas column layout while it is converted from a fixed four
gases to one set per configured gas. The output format is positional and
FCC parses it by comma counts, so a group converted in the header but not
in the reader shifts every later field and is consumed without error.

## Running

    BASE=base_rec.eddyflow bash run.sh ref     # before the change
    BASE=base_rec.eddyflow bash run.sh chk     # after it
    diff -r out_ref out_chk

`run.sh` now normalises recursively, so `diff -r` on two run directories is
the whole comparison. It used to normalise only the top level, which left 21
of the 25 output files carrying the run timestamp in their names - every one
of them read as added *and* removed, burying whatever had really changed.

Two runs from an unchanged tree must diff clean. If they do not, the
normalisation is incomplete and every verdict from it is worthless; check
that before trusting a difference.

## Fixtures

| file | what it is for |
|---|---|
| `base.eddyflow` | pre-5.0.0 project, no gas records. Must abort with `Fatal error(99)`. |
| `base_rec.eddyflow` | the same selection as records: 4 gases, CH4 configured *without* a column, cell_t/int_p and the 7200 diagnostic as records. **Output must stay byte-identical** to the legacy reference - that is the proof a conversion is faithful. |
| `base_5gas.eddyflow` | adds N2O on column 9. Header and rows must agree; no duplicate column names. |
| `base_dup.eddyflow` | the same species in slots 4 and 5, to check the `_2` disambiguation. |
| `base_8gas.eddyflow` | eight gases across **two** analysers: the MIRO's four plus the LI-7200's CO2 and H2O, and a duplicate N2O. Exercises the capacity target (64 gases, 8 per instrument) and, because the two analysers measure the same species independently, catches slot cross-wiring: `CO2` and `CO2_2` must hold *different* real values, not the same one twice. |
| `base_neg.eddyflow` | `base_5gas` with `al_gas4_min` raised to 400, so COS fails the absolute-limits test. The negative fixture: exactly one gas's columns must move. Diff it against the `base_5gas` run, not against a reference. |

## The arithmetic cross-check

`nMainFields` in `read_ex_record.f90` should equal the header's main-record
width - the columns from `DOY_START` up to the first `*_NREX`. Measuring that
from a run and comparing against the formula is what localised a six-field
under-count that only appeared past four gases:

| gases | main-record width |
|---|---|
| 4 | 263 |
| 5 | 298 |
| 8 | 409 |

All three are confirmed against real runs. 64 gases gives 4133 by the same
formula, untested for want of a dataset.

## Traps that produced false results before

- **RP only.** FCC recomputes under `fcc_follows`; an RP-only run compares
  files nothing wrote. `run.sh` runs both.
- **Timestamp normalisation must recurse** into the per-period
  subdirectories, or every one reads as an added/removed file.
- **A fixture that is under-specified silently tests the old path.** An
  earlier `base_rec` carried gas records only, so cell temperature, cell
  pressure and the diagnostic were still arriving through the legacy tags
  and every "record path IDENTICAL" verdict rested on that.
- **"Nothing moved" is not a pass.** Perturbing `gas_N_mw` moves nothing
  for a gas reported as a ppb mole fraction - the molecular weight is only
  consulted for the `g_m3`/`mg_m3`/`ug_m3` arms. Use `ug_m3` to exercise it.
- The engine links `libgfortran-5.dll` dynamically; `PATH` needs the MinGW
  bin directory.
